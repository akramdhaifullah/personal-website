          Hello, my name is Muhammad Akram Dhaifullah, you can call me Akram.
          I'm originally from Indonesia. I've been living with my family in West
          Sumbawa because of the pandemic the world has been going through right
          now. Currently, I'm on my 4th semester learning about coding and
          technology, and I gotta say, I'm enjoying everything that I have right
          now.
          <br /><br />
          Although some people might say, "coding is very hard", or "you don't
          need a degree to work into tech companies", I fully disagee with all
          of that. I think that there is a lot to learn to be fully ready for
          the working environment, not just knowing how to code. There are lots
          of working field when it comes to technology. There are programmers,
          developers, which are the common ones when people think about computer
          science. But there are uncommon ones like scientists, engineers, and
          much more.
          <br /><br />
          Btw, this is my try on creating a website using HTML and CSS
          programming language, and I think for my first try, its good. Although
          it doesn't have fancy features like animations, or transitions, I
          think for my first try, this is a good website and I will be
          implementing more features while also gaining more knowledge learning
          through college.
